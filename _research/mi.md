I started my project with Mats shortly after I arrived in Sweden for my study abroad at KTH. The [research group](https://www.mi.physics.kth.se/web/home.htm), led by Dr. Mats Danielson, works on medical imaging. I quickly started learning about the physics inside CT scanner sensors. This aligned really well with the electrodynamics courses I started taking that semester as well.

I've developed a sufficient understanding of the [Allpix Squared](https://allpix-squared.docs.cern.ch/) simulation framework. Now, I am currently working on developing a new module to implement other physics phenomena into the propogation of charge carriers. The project is ongoing, and will come to a successfull conclusion before I leave in June.
