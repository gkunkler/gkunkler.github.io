Hi! I'm Garrett, a fourth-year mechanical engineering major at [Cal Poly SLO](https://www.calpoly.edu/). For the current academic year (24-25), I will be in Stockholm, Sweden studying abroad at [KTH University](https://www.kth.se/en). In the fall of 2025, I will return to San Luis Obispo to finish my bachelor's degree and graduate Spring 2026.

While I am studying mechanical engineering, my desire to be closer to the pursuit of knowledge has drawn me to math and physics minors. My favorite parts of the projects I’ve worked on have been the theoretical derivations and analysis of data. I have also shifted my extracurricular focus towards physics research opportunities, which have further solidified this career trajectory. 

I’ve been fostering my programming skills since high school. What started as a weekly Java course through the [League of Amazing Programmers'](https://www.jointheleague.org/) has blossomed into a passion for programming on my own. I have expanded to Python, MATLAB, etc., which has supported my confidence to dive into challenging problems with the expectation that I will pick up the syntax along the way. You can check out the projects I've written about in the [Coding Projects](https://gkunkler.github.io/coding/) section of my website.

During my time in university I have participated in multiple internship opportunities where I could test my experience against professional standards and continue to direct the development of my skills towards a fullfilling career. Descriptions of these positions can be found in the [Work Experience](https://gkunkler.github.io/work/) section of my website. Brief overviews of the research work I have done is located [here](https://gkunkler.github.io/research/).

I also have a [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/gkunkler) page that highlights my professional accomplishments. If you want to see more of my coding projects you can check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/gkunkler), but I don't update that too often.

And finally, here's my [resume](/assets/downloads/Resumes/GarrettKunkler_Resume_2025-05-07.pdf) for a more concise viewing of my professional work. 

Thanks for reading!
