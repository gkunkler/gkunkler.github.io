  <h2>Project Description</h2>
  <p>This is a python project I worked on in order to refresh my knowledge of python and neural network code. I created a
    custom flappy bird game and trained the neural network to play it.
    </p>
  <h2>Development</h2>
  <p>From scratch, I created a set of classes and subclasses to take an arbitrary amount of data and return an arbitrary number of outputs.
Originally I followed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo5dMEP_BbI&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDcjD5BAw2DxE6OF2tius3V3" >sentdex's youtube tutorial</a> for a
classification neural network. However, the whole video series hasn't been released yet, and my goal for the project wasn't classification, so I wrote
my own generational improvement algorithm. I modeled it after a <a href="https://github.com/AdinAck/2048-AI">similar project</a> I worked on a while ago.</p>
