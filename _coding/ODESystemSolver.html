  <h2>Project Description</h2>
  <p>This project is a MATLAB program that solves systems of first order, linear, homogeneous, ordinary differential equations. It can display the transformed vectors, eigenvectors,
    the phase plane, and animate the direction of the solution curves.</p>
  <h2>Development</h2>
  <p>This was my first experience with MATLAB. After taking linear analysis in winter 2022, my professor, <a href="https://math.calpoly.edu/paul-choboter">Dr. Choboter</a>,
  recommended that I try to apply some of the concepts of the class in MATLAB.</p>
  <p>I learned how to manipulate matrices, solve equations, plot functions, and other MATLAB syntax while making this project.
  I also deepened my understanding of differential equations as I was able to see all of the different aspects of linear
  algebra that work together when solving differential equations.</p>
  <h2>Download</h2>
  <p>If you would like to try out the program for yourself, here is a <a href="/assets/downloads/ODE_System_solver.m">download link</a> for the
    fully commented code file.</p>
