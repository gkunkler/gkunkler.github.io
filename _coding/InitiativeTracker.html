  <h2>Project Description</h2>
  <p>
    This is a Discord Bot I used when playing D&D virtually. Players input their initiative roll, and the program will then print the turn order.
    There is also functionality to remove and change initiative values as well as let everyone know whether their command was valid.
  </p>
  <h2>Development</h2>
  <p>This project was a personal application of the Discord Bot's I created during my classes with the <a href="https://www.jointheleague.org/">League</a>.
    It was forked from the <a href="https://github.com/LEAGUE-Level6/DiscordBot">Level 6 Discord Bots</a> we worked on.
    This is where I was introduced to collaborative coding principles with Github and APIs.
  </p>
  <p>I started with just adding values to an <code>ArrayList</code> when a specific command was typed, but I eventually found that a <code>HashMap</code> was a better option.
    I used the player's nickname in Discord as well as the value after the !addinit command in the display message.
  </p>
  <p>In order to sort the initiatives by value, I first sorted just the numbers after removing duplicates. I used the built in <code>Collections.sort()</code> to make an ordered list of the initiatives.
    After that, I go through that list from high to low and add the players to the output when their value matches the given initiative. This is then displayed when the output command is typed.
  </p>
  <p>During testing, I found that I needed more flexibility in the commands so that I didn't have to restart the bot everytime someone made a mistake.
    Some additions I made were the ability to change and remove initiative values, which were pretty simple to implement. All I needed to do was edit the <code>HashMap</code> values.
    My favorite touch to this project was my ability to add reactions to the command messages. In order for players to know when their command was correct, the bot will add a thumbs up reaction
     to their message. It will also put a thumbs down when their command isn't applicable along with an informative message.
  </p>
  <p>This project was very useful during the pandemic when my friends and I couldn't play D&D in person and our typical Initiative tracking systems wouldn't work.
    It was used many times, which gave me many opportunities to improve and refine my design, so it was definitely worth making.

  <h2>Download</h2>
  <p>If you would like to use this Discord Bot in your game, you can clone the repository <a href="https://github.com/Rettdog/Initiative-Tracker-Discord-Bot">here</a>. You will need to add it to
    the <a href="https://discord.com/developers/applications">discord developer's page</a>, edit the channel name, and edit the key.</p>
  <p>In 2023, I ported the code to python so that it would be easier to run. I also added improvements such as saving player names in text files and more adaptable commands.
